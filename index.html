    <h2>Welcome to PriST-AI 2023!</h2>
    <p>


Artificial Intelligence (AI) with its learning techniques, including Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), 
shows a significant evolution in data processing and analysis that is rapidly changing human life. 
AI-based solutions have already been used in many real-world applications, including but not limited to, 
the Internet of Things/Vehicles (IoT/ IoV), Smart Grid and Energy saving, Fog/Edge computing, Face/Image recognition, 
Text/Sentimental analysis, Attack detection, and Healthcare.
While AI has worldwide applications, yet unsecure, biased, unreliable, 
and privacy violating data processing and communication negatively affect its applications (and consequently the society). 
Accordingly, this workshop co-located with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.esorics2023.org/">ESORICS 2023</a>  
aims to bring researchers and professionals across academia and industries to exchange ideas, 
present early results, and provide future visions on Private, Secure, Trustworthy AI (PriST AI). 
</p>
    <p>
The topics of interest are included, but not limited to:
 </p>
    <p>
•	Privacy preserving machine learning, deep learning, and federated learning
  </p>
<p>
•	Trustworthy machine learning
</p>
<p>
•	Metrics in private, secure, and trustworthy AI
</p>
<p>
•	Adversarial attacks against AI models
</p>
<p>
•	Cryptography and security protocols in AI
</p>
<p>
•	Privacy by design in AI-based systems
</p>
<p>
•	Applications of private, secure, and trustworthy AI
</p>
<p>




        This website is a template that you could use for a (small small sm) academic conference. 
        It&rsquo;s got a page for registration, where you can embed a Google Form or some other way for participants to register.
        It&rsquo;s got a program page to list the schedule for the conference.
        It&rsquo;s got a directions page to add a bunch of instructions how to get to the conference.
        It&rsquo;s got a page to put up the flyers and other promotional materials for folks to download.

        This template was created from a website I made for 
        <a target="_blank" href="http://math.ucr.edu/~mathconn/">MathConnections 2019</a>,
        in case you want to see an example of this template being used in the wild.

        This paragraph is just some filler text to give the homepage some volume:

    <h2>Organizers</h2>
    <p>
        Here&rsquo;s a good place to list the organizers and sponsors of the conference,
        as well as list contact information for the organizers,
        and show off the logos of the sponsors.
        It looks like his conference was sponsored by kittens!
