<h2>Paper Submissions</h2>
    <p>

To submit a paper to the symposium, it is important that the content of the paper does not significantly 
duplicate any papers that have been previously published, or that are currently being reviewed by a 
journal or conference/workshop with published proceedings. It is also worth noting that the proceedings 
of the symposium will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.



    </p>
<p>
<h2>Paper Template</h2>

All submitted papers should adhere to the LNCS template at the time of submission. 
Additionally, papers should not exceed 16 pages, excluding the bibliography and appendices that are clearly marked, 
and must not exceed a total of 20 pages. It is important to note that committee members are not obliged to read the appendices; 
therefore, the paper should be easily comprehensible without them. Lastly, all submissions must be written in English.




    </p>
<p>
<h2> Submissions must be uploaded to the following EasyChair website:</h2>
 




    </p>
<p>

Submissions that do not conform to the guidelines specified above may be rejected without 
any evaluation of their quality. All submissions should be in PDF format, and anonymity is not required. 
It is mandatory for the authors of the accepted papers to adhere to the Springer LNCS copyright policy and 
ensure that their papers are presented at the conference.
